        <h2>Day 1</h2>

        <h3>The journey begins with the idea of just travelling for hours. There are many ways of
            travelling to Lapland. Some people prefer train, some by flight and people who really enjoy driving and
            wanna experience the nature and see how wonderful the experience of driving in snow is. With us, it was
            pretty much cleared that we are going there with car and we started our journey around 7 in the morning.
            For first couple of hours it was just cities and road but slowly when we crossed a bit cemented forest,
            nature started to show us what we have never seen. The views and all the scenes can't be expressed in
            words. After driving for 6 hours, we had our lunch. Well it was more of a power nap in car than just
            lunch. In total driving for almost 13 hours, we finally made it to the place. It was a cottage in Levi,
            located between the forest, next to a lake.

        <h2>Day 2</h2>
        <h3>On the second day, we started to explore the place as before we left Helsinki, we already had a plan for
            the activities. After leaving the cottage, we went to the Levi center for breakfast and also to explore
            the local market and shops.</h3>
